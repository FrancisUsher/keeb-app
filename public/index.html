    <p>
      Welcome to keeb.app.
      I do care about users who don't want scripts running in their browser.
      Unfortunately everything interesting in this app is run client-side.
      That means in order to use any of the features, you need to be running
      javascript in your web browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please check back in the future when I have the budget to run a server
      that will allow me to statically render this site.
